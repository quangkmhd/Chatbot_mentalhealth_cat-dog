    <div class="about-section">
        <h2>What is Pet Health?</h2>
        <p>Pet Health is an AI-powered assistant designed to provide information and advice about pets, particularly dogs and cats. Using advanced natural language processing and a comprehensive database of pet-related information, our chatbot can answer questions about pet care, health issues, training, and more.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="about-section">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Pet Health uses a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate and relevant information:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> We've collected and processed information from reliable pet care resources, including <a href="https://www.petmart.vn/cho-canh" target="_blank">PetMart</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Vector Database:</strong> This information is stored in a vector database (LanceDB) that allows for semantic search.</li>
            <li><strong>Embedding:</strong> When you ask a question, it's converted into a mathematical representation (embedding) using a multilingual model.</li>
            <li><strong>Retrieval:</strong> The system finds the most relevant information in the database based on your question.</li>
            <li><strong>Generation:</strong> A large language model (Llama-3.3-70b) uses the retrieved information to generate a comprehensive answer.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="about-section">
